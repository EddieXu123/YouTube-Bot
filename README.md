# YouTube Bot
Second of the 5 Bots in 5 Days project

YouTube Bot that likes every video on a channel (And I guess unlikes every liked video? :O). WORKS FOR EVERY CHANNEL! Just change the URL to the video page of your channel!

At first, I wanted to create a bot that would spam "like" a video. However, after creating around 5 accounts using the same phone number, I ran into the issue of "This phone number has been used too many times", meaning I could no longer create anymore gmail accounts (forever D:) with this phone number. 
\

As a result, I changed trajectories and decided to create a bot that would like every video on a channel. This was relatively easy: I could just sign into my gmail, go to the channel's videos, hit the "Play All" button, which would bring me to a playlist with around 100 of the channels videos, push every video in that playlist into an Array/List, access each video in that array, and then like each video.
